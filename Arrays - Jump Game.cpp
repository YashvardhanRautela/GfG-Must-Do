/*
In this way, make a jumps[] array from left to right such that jumps[i] indicate the minimum number of jumps needed to reach arr[i] from arr[0].
To fill the jumps array run a nested loop inner loop counter is j and outer loop count is i.
Outer loop from 1 to n-1 and inner loop from 0 to i.
if i is less than j + arr[j] then set jumps[i] to minimum of jumps[i] and jumps[j] + 1. initially set jump[i] to INT MAX
Finally, return jumps[n-1].
